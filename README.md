If you need reusable components for your next flow, this is the place to find them!
As you might have guessed, the focus lies on reusability and simplicity, just like the [flow-based programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming) paradigm suggests.
Contributions welcome!

## Installation

As of now, not needed because it's already included in phpflo/phpflo :-)

Otherwise:
```shell
composer require phpflo/phpflo-core
```
